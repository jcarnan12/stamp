						<p>As students ourselves, we understand how feels to be confused, or even disconnected from the material being outlined in a course. Even though there are 
							a plethora of online resources available for us to access, it would be nice to have a direct network or academic support system within your 
							academic community. We want to make communication between classmates easier by connecting them through a common social media platform for them to ask questions, meet others in their classes or school, and strengthen the community by connecting with other students 
						STAMP combines all of this. An easy and accessible platform- our network addresses all of the issues that 
							face students across the country today. </p>

						<br><center><h2>About Us</h2></center>
						<p> We are a group of five girls who have come together through a program called Girls Who Code. Coming from completely
							different backgrounds, we have spent the past seven weeks coding together and not only learning concrete
							computational skills, but also valuable lessons through our shared experiences in the program. 
							Our final project manifests itself in this form: a social media platform 
						that allows high school students to communicate with each other. STAMP enables users to ask questions not only to 
						other students in the school, but also directly contact their teachers for assistance. Our goal is to provide this 
							assistance to the students who need it, as well as strengthen the 
						academic community through creating deeper relationships amongst classmates and teachers. </p>

								<h3>Girls Who Code</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Girls Who Code is a national non-profit organization that is dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology. 
						 	Back in 2010, Reshma Saujani, the founder, was inspired to create Girls Who Code upon firsthandedly witnessing the 
								lack of girls in local high school 
								computer science classes. Her experiment turned into a national movement- empowering girls to delve into previously
								male-dominated sectors and equipping them with important computing skills. There are now over 150 Girls Who Code clubs across America, and the organization aims to teach one million girls to code by 2020.
						</p>
							
							<h4>Reshma Saujani, CEO and Founder:</h4>
					<blockquote>"We're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. <br><br>
						And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has 
						caused us to take less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing 
						and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and 
						problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. <br><br>
						So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection.

								<h3>BlackRock</h3>

							<p>BlackRock is a global financial planning and investment management firm headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is now the world's largest asset manager,

								incorporation of IPSoft's Amelia, as well as the growing Aladdin Product Group.

							<h4>Lisa Dallmer, COO of BlackRock's Global Technology and Operations Group:</h4>
					<blockquote>"Our partnership with Girls Who Code has been a remarkable experience for BlackRock employees as we’ve mentored a group of diverse young women as they learned to code and discovered the possibilities that lie ahead within the technology industry."</blockquote>
